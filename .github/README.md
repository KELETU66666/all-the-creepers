## Dependencies

In order to get started with Minecraft mod development in this workspace, a few prerequisites are required:

1. [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
2. [Java Development Kit 8](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html) (JDK 8)
3. *(Optional)* [Gradle](http://gradle.org/gradle-download/)

> If you don't manually install Gradle, just append a `w` to `gradle` command prefixes.
> This will install the Gradle wrapper once, and any proceeding commands should be executed using it.

### Windows
I highly recommend using [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/install),
and installing everything by executing the following commands:
```bash
choco install jdk8
choco install gradle --version 4.4.1
```
I'd recommend running the Powershell variant.

### OSX
I highly recommend using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/),
and installing everything by executing the following commands:
```bash
brew cask install java
brew install gradle --version 4.4.1
```
If you don't have Apple's Command Line Utilities installed before installing Homebrew, they will be installed automatically.
Be sure you're using an Administrator account if this is the case.

## Workspace Setup

If you plan to use the Eclipse IDE, then execute:
```bash
gradle setupEclipseWorkspace
```
else just run the typical:
```bash
gradle setupDecompWorkspace
```

Depending on your internet connection and the processing power of your machine, it may take a while to build.
For most people it takes about 10 minutes.

After that just run either `gradle eclipse` or `gradle idea`, depending on your IDE.
